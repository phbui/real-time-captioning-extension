0:01
Hold on.
0:05
That's really impressive.
0:06
Thanks.
0:06
How did you learn to do the rings?
0:08
I'm from the Bay area.
0:18
What's your drink of choice?
0:19
Vodka.
0:20
Really?
0:21
Yeah.
0:21
I'm really Caucasian like that.
0:23
Hmm, I was gonna say water.
0:24
Oh girl, no.
0:27
Ayyyyyy!
0:29
Whaaaaaat?
0:30
Girl, you knew.
0:33
This one isn’t right.
0:35
What...
0:36
what?
0:37
It doesn’t have limes, babe.
0:43
Are you into geography?
0:44
No.
0:45
Why?
0:46
Um, because I'm from America, babe.
0:47
The only geography I know is
0:49
California.
0:51
Not the...
0:56
Would you say that you were
0:57
a romantic person?
0:58
I can be romantic.
1:00
Yeah?
1:01
It depends on the situation.
1:02
I feel like I need to, like,
1:04
be with the right person
1:05
because no one really gets my freak.
1:08
How would you describe your freak?
1:10
Probably gay.
1:15
Is um,
1:16
New York a romantic place?
1:17
It can be.
1:18
I, again, think it just is about the people
1:20
‘cause so many people there are
1:21
up their own arse.
1:23
Arse.
1:23
Yeah, I'm trying to be British.
1:29
Are you quite blind?
1:31
Yeah, I'm really blind.
1:31
That's why I'm wearing these glasses.
1:36
Are you modeling right now?
1:37
Yes.
1:37
Okay.
1:39
Ah!
1:41
Sam, what you think boo?
1:43
I'm selling it.
1:44
Everybody get you a boneless.
1:45
Um...
1:46
Sam, is this gluten free?
1:48
I don't think it is.
1:49
I think he's scared of me.
1:50
So you like boneless?
1:52
Yes, babe.
1:52
I can't eat the bone.
1:58
My type’s model of the year.
2:00
Ohhh!
2:01
Ooooh!
2:02
Okay well, today's your perfect date then.
2:04
What do you do to make a date, um,
2:05
not awkward?
2:06
My favourite thing to do is not bring my wallet.
2:09
That kind of always makes it awkward.
2:11
One time I went on a date with someone
2:13
ooh, I have a lot of
2:14
interesting date stories, babe.
2:15
I need to tell you about this one in particular.
2:17
I didn't bring my wallet,
2:18
and I guess neither did he.
2:21
Humbled me.
2:26
Do you think a fashion show
2:27
is a good place to fall in love?
2:29
Hell, no.
2:29
Actually.
2:30
Lowkey yes.
2:32
I do, I've always had this like,
2:33
freaky
2:35
um, dream of having sex backstage
2:37
at a fashion show.
2:38
And did it, has it ever happened?
2:39
Nuh-uh.
2:40
What has to happen do you think
2:42
for that to happen?
2:43
Um, I need to be around someone
2:44
that's not gay.
2:50
Do you think you'd make a good
2:51
nurse in real life?
2:53
No girl, I don't know how to do any of that shit.
2:55
Like, how do I take a pulse?
2:56
Do you know how to take a pulse?
2:57
Well, I think you put your
2:58
fingers, like, on their skin.
3:00
Or something like that.
3:02
No, not on the elbow.
3:02
That's a bone.
3:07
I heard that if you weren't a model,
3:08
you'd be a mathematician.
3:09
I would.
3:10
Mm-hmm.
3:10
I would love to be a circus performer.
3:12
Mmm!
3:14
Tight rope with this
3:15
tight p*ssy.
3:17
Okay.
3:17
I feel like that makes sense.
3:19
What would you do girl?
3:20
Well I actually would love to be a dancer.
3:22
Ay.
3:23
Background?
3:25
That was so shady
3:26
I’m kidding!
3:31
I don't want to be a background dancer.
3:32
Oh.
3:33
I want to be the star performer.
3:34
Oh my God.
3:35
Okay, period.
3:36
So like dancing with the stars?
3:37
Why did that?
3:37
Why wasn’t that the first thing
3:39
that came to your head with me?
3:40
Because I want to be a background dancer.
3:41
Well, good for you.
3:42
We would make a great um, combination.
3:45
Okay, cool.
3:45
Well, if it was me and you together
3:47
then I would be, kind of down.
3:48
Diva down.
3:48
Diva down?
3:49
Diva down.
3:49
Diva down.
3:50
But you’d be diva up.
3:51
Diva up?
3:51
And you'd be down.
3:53
None of us are down.
3:53
We going up from here.
4:00
Who's Victoria and what's her secret?
4:03
Well, Victoria is actually
4:05
this middle aged man named Victor.
4:07
Yeah
4:08
and he doesn't have any secrets.
4:09
He's an open book.
4:14
Are you artistic?
4:16
Artistic?
4:16
Mm-hmm.
4:17
Yeah...
4:18
I'm like...
4:19
“Yes!”
4:20
I'm very artistic, honestly.
4:21
Like, it's like my thing.
4:22
Like, if you know me, you know I'm artistic.
4:24
So I'm surprised you didn't know that.
4:26
Do you, like, believe in witches?
4:27
Yeah.
4:29
I am one!
4:31
I'm a witch.
4:32
Believe it or...
4:41
Has anyone ever shit their pants
4:43
during a date?
4:44
Not that I know of.
4:45
Would you like?
4:46
Would you like?
4:50
Ooh oh oh!
4:51
Sorry.
4:51
I just shit my pants.
4:53
Just kidding, I didn’t.
4:58
I'm a Cancer.
5:00
Are you? Leo cusp.
5:02
So I was born in Leo, but.
5:03
So you’re a Leo?
5:04
Yeah.
5:06
But I'm a cusp.
5:07
You know what that means?
5:07
So it's like I was born...
5:09
this is actually c*nt.
5:10
I was born at 4:20AM
5:11
the first day of Leo.
5:14
I get on really well with Leo’s.
5:16
Period, makes sense.
5:17
Aquarius.
5:18
Love it.
5:19
Baddie.
5:19
Really?
5:20
B-H-A-D.
5:21
Bhad.
5:21
Bhad.
5:22
That’s you.
5:23
Okay.
5:23
Well, I'm glad that.
5:24
Wait, do you believe in star signs, though?
5:25
Or is it just-
5:26
I do.
5:26
I like used to not,
5:28
but I feel like now more than ever,
5:29
I'm like meeting people and I'm like,
5:31
it gives like,
5:32
your sign, no shade.
5:33
Sometimes, like Aquarius is good,
5:36
Taurus is fine,
5:37
Aries is great.
5:38
Yeah.
5:39
Gemini?
5:48
Well, someone told me I look 30
5:50
the other day at work.
5:51
A makeup artist.
5:52
They were doing my makeup and they said,
5:53
“How old are you.”
5:54
I said, “Guess.”
5:54
She goes, looks me dead in the eyes,
5:56
“30.”
5:57
That's crazy, ‘cause you’re only...
5:59
21. 14.
6:00
21?
6:01
21!
6:03
No, honestly, it was.
6:08
Do you think there's a misconception
6:09
that models don't have a personality?
6:11
Or are you just the only exception?
6:13
I mean some of them have personalities,
6:14
but they're just not fun.
6:16
They're just very
6:17
concerned with their appearance
6:18
maybe over anything else?
6:19
No one wants to be ugly anymore.
6:21
Mmm.
6:22
I mean like you don't always
6:23
need to be serving c*nt.
6:25
Do you think that beauty is actually
6:28
more important on the inside
6:29
than the outside?
6:30
I've always said this,
6:30
I don't know if you agree,
6:31
but I don't remember what someone looks like.
6:33
I remember how they act.
6:37
Do you think that I would suit
6:38
a bleached brow?
6:40
Yeah.
6:41
That, it sounded like
6:43
that was a no.
6:44
Yes...
6:49
Would you go to space?
6:50
No.
6:52
I don't like that.
6:53
I feel like I already give alien.
6:54
Oo ee aa ee
6:55
Oo oo ee ee aa aa ee!
6:57
So I kind of wanna just
6:58
do it here.
7:03
Maybe it's actually fun being single.
7:04
Maybe we don't need anyone.
7:06
I think 2025
7:07
is the year of being single.
7:10
Wow.
7:10
Actually.
7:12
Profound.
7:12
Yeah ‘cause I mean,
7:13
yeah being in a relationship is fun
7:15
but like, so much work.
7:21
Are you paying, or?
7:22
‘Cause I didn't bring my wallet, so.
7:24
Classic you.
7:25
I've already paid.
7:26
Ayy!
7:26
Aww!
7:33
People say models don't eat, but.
7:34
Well, I ate, so,
7:36
y'all can stay mad.
7:37
You already ate.
7:38
Believe it or not it’s actually
7:38
10AM right now.
7:40
Don’t...
7:41
Sorry, I’m ruining the fantasy.
7:44
It’s 10AM you guys.
7:45
It’s not.
